  "statement": "Evidence flow is not fully wired end-to-end because search results are not persisted to the evidences table and stage completion does not advance/enqueue subsequent stages.",
  "confidence": 0.68,
  "rationale": "Window orchestration only operates over existing evidences and applyRequestResult updates per-evidence columns but does not advance the window or enqueue the next stage; runWindowSearch returns results without insertion.",
  "keyAssumptions": [
    "No other hidden ingestion/stage-advancement mutations exist",
    "Window processing should be stage-sequential without manual intervention"
  ],
  "validationCriteria": [
    "Add an ingestion mutation that inserts evidences with l0_raw_content",
    "Add stage completion logic that moves windows to next stage and enqueues",
    "Evidence flow can be tested by creating a window, ingesting, and observing l1->l3 completion"
  ],
  "critiquePoints": [
    "Ingestion/stage transitions might be implemented in other branch code or planned elsewhere",
    "The system may intentionally rely on external orchestration rather than automatic stage chaining"
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Where should stage progression live: window_service, orchestrator, or scheduler?",
    "Should stage progression be per-evidence or per-window completion?"
  ]
