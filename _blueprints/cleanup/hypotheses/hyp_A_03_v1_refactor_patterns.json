  "statement": "The refactor-everything branch shows a viable pattern: stage-local workflows enqueue LLM requests based on sequential gating, while a centralized scheduler handles batch lifecycle. Reusing that separation (stage workflow vs scheduler) can simplify orchestrator cleanup without losing pipeline discipline.",

  "rationale": "Refactor-everything uses evidence workflows to enqueue requests per stage and a runs scheduler to poll/submit batches; this matches the desired separation of concerns and avoids window-specific coupling in llm_calls services.",
