  "statement": "The README should highlight the idempotent LLM request ledger: `llm_requests` are de-duplicated by identity (stage/provider/model/experiment/rubric/sample/evidence/request_version) and `getOrCreate` ensures retries resolve to the same ledger entry unless the version changes.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "rationale": "Schema and request helpers enforce identity-based de-duplication; this is a key refactor goal and user asked to emphasize idempotency guarantees.",
  "keyAssumptions": ["Idempotency is a core selling point for operators and should be documented upfront."],
  "validationCriteria": ["README includes a short ‘Idempotency Guarantees’ section explaining the identity key and when new rows are created."],
  "critiquePoints": ["Need to avoid over-promising if there are edge cases (e.g., prompt updates without version bump)."],
  "questions": ["Are there any known exceptions to idempotency (e.g., manual patches) that should be noted?"]
