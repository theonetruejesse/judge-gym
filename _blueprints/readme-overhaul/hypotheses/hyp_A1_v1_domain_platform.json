  "statement": "The README should explicitly map the new domain/platform split (experiments, runs, llm_calls vs providers/rate_limiter/utils) and stage-local workflows to the repo layout so contributors can locate core responsibilities quickly.",
  "confidence": 0.66,
  "rationale": "Evidence shows the Convex backend is now organized under domain/ and platform/ with stage-local workflows; the current README still describes the old flat layout.",
  "keyAssumptions": ["Contributors rely on README for architecture orientation."],
  "validationCriteria": ["Updated README includes a section that mirrors the current folder layout under packages/engine/convex/domain and /platform."],
  "critiquePoints": ["Too much detail in README could overwhelm; might need an overview plus link to deeper docs."],
  "questions": ["Should we include a pointer to packages/engine/convex/README.md or move details there?"]
