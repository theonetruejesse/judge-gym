  "statement": "The README should describe how run policies are enforced server-side across queue/submit/poll/finalize and how the Lab supervisor mirrors (not overrides) those policies, clarifying infra synchronization and retry controls.",
  "confidence": 0.68,
  "rationale": "RunPolicy is persisted on runs and re-checked in batch queue, submit, and poll workflows; Lab uses the same schema to configure local scheduling.",
  "keyAssumptions": ["Readers need to understand which controls are authoritative (server) vs advisory (lab)."],
