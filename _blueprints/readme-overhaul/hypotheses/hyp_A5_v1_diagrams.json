  "statement": "Adding 2–3 architecture diagrams (e.g., system context, LLM ledger flow, policy/infra sync loop) will materially improve README clarity for new contributors and operators.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "rationale": "The system has multiple interacting modules (lab, Convex domain/platform, provider adapters, analysis) and a multi-step ledger flow that is hard to grasp without visuals.",
  "keyAssumptions": ["Mermaid diagrams are acceptable for the repo’s README tooling."],
  "validationCriteria": ["README includes at least one system overview diagram and one ledger flow diagram that match the refactored structure."],
  "critiquePoints": ["Diagrams can drift if not maintained; they must be high-level and stable."],
  "questions": ["Should diagrams live in README or in a dedicated docs/architecture file with a README link?"]
