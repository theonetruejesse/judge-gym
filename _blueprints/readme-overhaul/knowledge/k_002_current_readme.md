**Summary:**
The root README outlines the monorepo structure and pipeline but reflects the pre-refactor Convex layout (e.g., `llm_*`, `workflows/`, `providers/`, `rate_limiter/`, `strategies/`, `prompts/` under `packages/engine/convex/`). It also describes design-space axes and CLI/Lab usage. This provides the baseline that now needs alignment with the domain/platform split and ledger-first batching.
