  "statement": "Evidence consistency across runs can be preserved by keeping experiment-level evidence binding while allowing run-level evidence_cap to decide how many bound items are used.",
  "confidence": 0.62,
  "rationale": "Evidence is frozen via experiment_evidence derived from a batch; run-level caps can operate on that frozen set if binding is unchanged.",
  "keyAssumptions": [
    "Binding can remain experiment-scoped without requiring per-run evidence subsets."

    "Confirm scoring reads experiment_evidence only; introduce run-level cap without altering bound set."

    "Per-run caps may need per-run evidence subsets for fairness or logging."

  "questions": [
    "Should runs ever re-slice evidence for different caps, or must cap be enforced at bind time?"
