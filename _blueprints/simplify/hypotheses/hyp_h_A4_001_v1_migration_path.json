  "statement": "A minimal migration can add run-level counts to run_configs, update run start + scoring/binding to read those counts, and keep experiment-level counts as fallback during transition.",
  "confidence": 0.64,
  "rationale": "Run creation already writes run_config snapshots and entrypoints can be extended; consumers can be updated incrementally.",

    "Backwards compatibility via fallback is acceptable for existing templates/tests/UI."

    "Tests and lab UI can be updated to supply run-level counts; no hard dependency on experiment counts remains."

    "Should we fully remove counts from experiment config after migration?"
