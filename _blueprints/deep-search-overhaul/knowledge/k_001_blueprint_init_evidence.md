**Summary:**
The original blueprint defines a sequential build plan and defense document for judge-gym, including a stage-based pipeline (evidence, rubric, scoring, probe) and a monorepo architecture with a Convex engine and a Python analysis package. It specifies explicit design principles (experiment-as-config, stage-based modules, workflows as API, single-store agent threads), enumerates the expected analysis modules/notebooks, and describes the full research protocol (ECC/control/benchmark tasks, DST vs JSD, rubric swap, fresh-window probes). This is the baseline for identifying deltas and for shaping the new refactor blueprint style.
