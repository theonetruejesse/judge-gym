**Summary:**
The working paper specifies a multi-stage evaluation pipeline (evidence collection/neutralization, rubric generation + critique, scoring with subset vs point verdicts, rubric swap, fresh-window probes) and analysis targets (JSD polarization, DST conflict, entrenchment, calibration). It also defines ECC/control/benchmark task types and emphasizes discriminant validity, rubric quality regression, and compression effects. The implementation plan must ensure data exports and schema fields support these analyses.
