  "statement": "Scaling requires a provider-abstracted batching service that supports staged batches (gen then critic), centralized rate limiting, `llm_requests`/`llm_batches`/`llm_batch_items`, and per-request idempotency for partial retries.",
  "confidence": 0.63,
  "rationale": "Workflow durability patterns exist and user requires provider batch APIs; staged batching is needed to gate critic passes on accepted generations.",
  "keyAssumptions": ["Provider batch APIs allow polling or webhook completion per batch."],
  "validationCriteria": ["Blueprint defines staged batch flow and per-request retry without resetting completed items."],
  "critiquePoints": ["Provider batch API semantics differ and may not support webhooks or fine-grained status."],
  "questions": ["Do we implement polling-only first with webhook as optional adapter?", "How do we surface partial failures to rerun only failed items?"]
