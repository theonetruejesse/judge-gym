  "statement": "The refactor should enforce mandatory critic passes for all tasks, standardizing naming as rubric_critic and score_critic (replacing probe naming) while preserving expert-agreement calibration in the scoring stage.",
  "confidence": 0.69,
  "rationale": "Current pipeline uses rubric critic and scoring prober; user requires mandatory critics and standardized naming, and paper methodology depends on expert-agreement data.",
  "keyAssumptions": ["Critic passes are required for ECC/control/benchmark tasks and should not be optional."],
  "validationCriteria": ["Blueprint plan includes mandatory score_critic for every score row and schema fields aligned to critic naming."],
  "critiquePoints": ["Mandatory critics increase cost and latency; scope may need tuning for large runs."],
  "questions": ["Is score_critic required per evidence item or per sample batch?", "Should critic outputs be stored as full text or only parsed scores in domain tables?"]
