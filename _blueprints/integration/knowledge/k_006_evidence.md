**Summary:**
The current branch’s `packages/engine/convex/packages/lab.ts` is just a placeholder comment, while the window flow is implemented in `window_service.ts` (`startWindowFlow`, `applyRequestResult`, stage progression) and `window_repo.ts` (`insertEvidenceBatch`, `listEvidenceByWindow`), providing the primitives needed for evidence-focused lab endpoints.
