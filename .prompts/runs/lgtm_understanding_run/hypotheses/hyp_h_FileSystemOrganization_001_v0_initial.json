    "Standardized organization enables effective tracking of complex multi-phase processes",
    "File naming conventions prevent confusion and support automated processing",

  "critiquePoints": [
    "File organization complexity might be excessive for simpler analyses",
    "Standardized formats could be too rigid for certain types of evidence or hypotheses",
    "Folder structure might become unwieldy for very large or long-running analyses",
    "Format requirements might discourage adoption due to setup complexity"
