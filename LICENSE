# Attachment A: Use Restrictions

You agree **not** to use the Source Code or its Derivatives in any of the following ways:

### 1. Legal and Regulatory

(a) In any way that violates any applicable national, federal, state, local, or international law or regulation.

### 2. Harm, Discrimination, and Profiling

(a) To generate or disseminate false information with the purpose of Harming others.
(b) To defame, disparage, or otherwise harass others.
(c) To exploit vulnerabilities of specific groups based on age, social, physical, or mental characteristics.
(d) **Political/Ideological Profiling:** To generate ideological profiles, "scores," or "indices" of specific individuals for the purpose of employment screening, insurance underwriting, credit scoring, or housing eligibility.

### 3. Transparency and Epistemic Integrity

(a) To generate machine-generated content without expressly and intelligibly disclaiming that it is machine-generated.
(b) To impersonate human beings for purposes of deception.
(c) **Consensus Hallucination:** To present machine-generated evaluations of essentially contested concepts (e.g., political, ethical, or aesthetic judgments) as representing "expert consensus" or "objective truth" without simultaneously disclosing the divergence metrics (such as Jensen-Shannon Divergence or Dempster-Shafer Conflict) produced by the Source Code.

### 4. Automated Decision Making and Policing

(a) For fully automated decision making that adversely impacts an individual’s legal rights or creates a binding, enforceable obligation.
(b) **Automated Policing:** To automate the identification of political or social content for the purpose of state-sponsored surveillance, law enforcement targeting, or the extra-judicial restriction of freedom of speech.
(c) **Unvetted Moderation:** To serve as the sole or primary basis for automated content moderation decisions (e.g., banning or deplatforming) without a mandatory human-in-the-loop review process that accounts for the documented epistemic limitations of the Source Code.

### 5. Institutional Context

(a) To represent the "Institutional Reflex" or "Proxy Signal" generated by the Source Code as an ontologically certain state of reality, rather than a mapping of latent discourse within specific Large Language Model training regimes.
